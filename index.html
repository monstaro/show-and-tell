            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p class="music-text">I have played music for pretty much as long as I can remember. I played violin from first grade until sixth. Afterwards, I realized guitar was 'cooler' so I quit violin and learned guitar. From then I've been playing in bands ever since. I
                play guitar, sing, and write songs. We play all around Denver, and have some shows in California during winter break. Here is a picture of us in San Diego.

            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p class="photography-text">
                Photography has been a hobby of mine for a long time. From my old point-and-shoot to a DSLR it's a great way to capture beauty in every day things. I have very little actual training but it is something I like to do for fun. I have a Canon Rebel and edit
                using Adobe Lightroom.
